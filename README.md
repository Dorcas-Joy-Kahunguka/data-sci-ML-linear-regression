# Profit Estimation with Linear Regression
Within this repository lies a guided project centered on crafting a linear regression model tailored for estimating company profits. Key factors such as investment in research and development (R&D), administrative expenses, and marketing costs are taken into account. By identifying the most influential contributors to profitability, the investment firm can strategically allocate their resources. For example, if R&D investment emerges as a primary determinant of profit, the firm will assess the R&D expenditure of potential companies to inform their investment decisions.
The project utilizes Python and Scikit-learn for implementation and aims to develop essential skills in data science and machine learning.

## Key Features
    -Develop a linear regression model for profit estimation using the least squares method.
    -Utilize Python and Scikit-learn for implementation.
    -Gain practical experience in data exploration, model development, and evaluation.
